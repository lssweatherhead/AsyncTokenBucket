# AsyncTokenBucket

Async TokenBucket 

This is a simplified, async re-write of the TokenBucket library here:
https://github.com/esendex/TokenBucket

The same license (Apache) has been applied as this is, essentially, a derivative work.

As this is a derivative work yet also a substantive re-write, changes to the original source code have not been individually annotated. You may assume that good code belongs to the original author and that mistakes, omissions or bad code is my fault.

Every await has a .ConfigureAwait(false), E&OE.

Targets .NET Standard 2.0
